                    and add it into the spice paste, then add the raddish and scallions.</li>

            <p>
                <li><strong>Let it ferment for 1-5 days:</strong>Place a bowl or plate under the jar to help catch any
                    overflow and let it stand at cool room temprature out of direct sunlight.</li>

                <li><strong>Check it daily and refrigerate when ready:</strong>Check it daily and press down with a
                    spoon to keep them submerged in the brine and to release gases.Taste and when it is good enough for
                    your liking, refrigerate it.</li></p>
